 * Public site configuration + portability knobs.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * During development the public site lives at  httpdocs/public/  and is served
 * from the URL path  /public .  When it goes live the Hub moves into its own
 * folder and the contents of  public/  move up to  httpdocs/ .  At that point
 * only the constants in this file need to change:
 *
 *   PUBLIC_BASE   -> ''            (served from the domain root)
 *   HUB_ROOT      -> <new path to the shared Hub code, or a vendored copy>
 *   UPLOADS_BASE  -> unchanged ('/uploads' stays at the domain root)
 *
 * See public/README.md for the full move procedure.
